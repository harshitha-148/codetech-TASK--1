overview of project

Project: Simple Calculator

1. Basic Arithmetic Operations
Perform fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Optionally include more advanced operations like modulus, exponentiation, or square roots.

2. Programming Practice
Develop problem-solving skills by implementing logic for handling mathematical computations.
Practice Python programming concepts such as variables, input/output, conditionals, loops, and functions.

3. User Interaction
Design a user-friendly interface for inputting numbers and selecting operations.
Provide meaningful output to the user, such as the result of the calculation.

4. Error Handling
Handle common errors like division by zero, invalid inputs, or incorrect operation choices.
Ensure program robustness and reliability through effective error management.

5. Code Modularity
Practice writing modular code by dividing functionality into reusable functions or methods.

6. Project Development
Gain experience in planning and building a complete small-scale project.
Enhance understanding of software development cycles: design, implementation, testing, and debugging.

7. Extensibility
Understand how to add more features (e.g., advanced operations or a graphical user interface) to the program in the future.
